- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mariuswies
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in UX design @ IMG.LY
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot. A lot is what I'm learning. Always has been.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...

The machines won't take over, but they're getting more crucial every day 
â€” you may have noticed. I utilize this to design for it. Facing 
topics from a designer's perspective or solving real life problems with
technology â€“ with or without a screen â€“ is what I do.

If you'd like to talk about a project, need a creative sparring partner or
have a funny joke to tell, contact me at ahoi@mariuswies.com and Iâ€™ll 
get back to you asap.
